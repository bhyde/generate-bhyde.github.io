This repository is responsible for building bhyde.github.io via
nanoc.  So it's a nanoc site directory as intialally created by
```nanoc create-site ...```.

It probably has little if any interest to you. But it might be
interesting as an example of how to build user pages via
nanoc.

The nanoc.yaml file arranges to generate the site into
../bhyde.github.io which presumably was cloned from github
and when you want to publish your changes you push them
from that directory.

Note that nanoc.yaml has two data sources, so content/assets can
be moved into the site unmodified.

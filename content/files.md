Some Files you can Download
---------------------------

Go-for-it is a bash script (see [repository](http://github./go-for-it))
that makes it safer to execute scripts that you have fetched from the
internet.  It requires those scripts be signed by a trusted key.

+ You can grab the bash script here: [go-for-it](/assets/go-for-it).
+ I sign mine using this key: [bhyde-go-for-it-key.asc](/assets/bhyde-go-for-it-key.asc), which
  presumably you'd add to your gnupg keyring.
